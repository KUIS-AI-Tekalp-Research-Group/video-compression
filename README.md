# KUIS AI Lab Research on Video Compression

This repository keeps research projects submitted by the researchers working under supervision of [Professor Ahmet Murat Tekalp](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mtekalp/) at Ko√ß University, KUIS AI Lab. The aim of our research is to develop learned video compression frameworks in order to achieve higher video quality at minimum bitrates.
